	<name>Working with XSL</name>
	<description>XSL is composed of three parts: XSL-FO 
	(Extensible Style sheet Language - Formatting Objects),
	 XSLT (Extensible Style sheet Language Transformations),
	 and XPath.  XSL-FO is used to implement page layout and design.
	 XSLT is used to transform XML content into another presentation format.
	 XPath is used to locate information from an XML document
	 and perform operations and calculations upon that content.

	<name>Introducing XSLT style sheets and processors</name>
	<description>An XSLT style sheet contains instructions for transforming
	 the contents of an XML document into another format. An XSLT style
	 sheet document is itself an XML document, but has an extension .xsl.
	 An XSLT style sheet converts a source document of XML content into
	 a result document containing the markup codes and other instructions
	 for formatting.
